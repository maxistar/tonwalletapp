# Ton Wallet

this project is part of Ton [Wallet Contest](https://github.com/ton-community/wallet-contest)

## Libraries used

In order to work with Ton Network the [tonutils-go](https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go) was used.

Scanner library [zxing-android-embedded](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded)

## Roadmap

Gomobile allows to write also iOS applications.
The initial plan for this contest was to provide also ios application using Kotlin Multiplatform but
this plan was too ambitious. The implementation of ios application will be done as a follow up stage.
